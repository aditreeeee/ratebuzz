// A Competitor Property is intentionally a parent-only entity: `propertyName`
// plus location/priority/status metadata, nothing comparison-shaped. Actual
// comparison detail lives one layer down, keyed by `competitorId`, in
// `ROOM_MAPPINGS` and `RATE_PLAN_MAPPINGS` below — and, through
// `RATE_PLAN_MAPPINGS.internalRatePlanId`, joins straight into this
// property's own `PRICING_RANGES` (src/mocks/ratePlans.js). Phase 3 will read
// through that same join to compare Pricing Ranges, Meal Plans, Occupancy,
// Date/Time Range, Cancellation Policy, Taxes & Fees, and Currency — no new
// mock tables are needed for that; the join path already exists.
