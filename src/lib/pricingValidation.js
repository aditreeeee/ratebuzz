// (or equal, since date-only ranges are inclusive on both ends). A blank

// ranges (one ends the day before the other starts) are NOT an overlap.
// A row with `alwaysApplicable: true` is unbounded by construction — the UI
// (PricingRangesTable) always clears its startDate/endDate to "" the moment
// that flag is set, so it naturally falls into the blank-start/blank-end case
// here with no separate code path needed.
